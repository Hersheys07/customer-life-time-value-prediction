# Customer Lifetime value prediction
The customer lifetime value (CLV) is a valuable metric that shows the total amount of money a business expects a customer to spend on products and services throughout the customer relationship.

It puts a numeric value on how valuable a specific customer or segmentâ€™s relationship is to the business and how much should be invested in that relationship.

Companies get insights about customers and can create well-informed marketing strategies to achieve their marketing goals and develop loyal customers who advocate for their brand.

In short, it helps focus on the long term profitability of business rather than short term gain so that both business and customers reap benefits.


In this project, We are going to build some machine learning models that predicts our customers lifetime value.
